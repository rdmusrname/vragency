These interactive elements not only entertain consumers but  also reinforce brand messaging and create memorable  experiences.

### Personalizing Marketing Campaigns with Contextual  Relevance

Augmented reality's ability to overlay digital content onto  the  physical  world enables brands to deliver highly personalized and contextually relevant marketing campaigns.
